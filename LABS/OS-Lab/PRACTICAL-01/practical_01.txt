AIM : 
To study the Introduction to Operating Systems (OS) — including the definition, functions, components, role, and history of Operating Systems along with case studies on Windows, Linux, MacOS.

THEORY : 

Question : What is an Operating System?
Answer : An Operating System (OS) is system software that acts as an interface between the computer hardware and the user.
It manages hardware resources (CPU, memory, I/O devices, files) and provides services so that users and application programs can run efficiently.

FUNCTIONS OF OPERATING SYSTEM

1. Process Management
	•	What it does:
Handles creation, scheduling, and termination of processes (programs in execution).
	•	Responsibilities:
	•	CPU scheduling (which process gets CPU next).
	•	Context switching (saving/restoring process states).
	•	Synchronization & deadlock handling.
	•	Example:
Windows Task Manager showing running processes.

2. Memory Management
	•	What it does:
Allocates and deallocates memory (RAM) to processes.
	•	Responsibilities:
	•	Keeps track of free and used memory.
	•	Provides virtual memory (using disk as extension of RAM).
	•	Ensures processes don’t interfere with each other’s memory.
	•	Example:
Paging & segmentation in Linux.

3. File System Management
	•	What it does:
Manages data storage, organization, retrieval, and permissions.
	•	Responsibilities:
	•	Creates, reads, writes, deletes files.
	•	Maintains file directories & metadata.
	•	Controls access rights (read/write/execute).
	•	Example:
NTFS in Windows, ext4 in Linux.

4. Device Management
	•	What it does:
Controls and coordinates use of hardware devices (I/O).
	•	Responsibilities:
	•	Provides device drivers.
	•	Handles interrupts (signals from devices).
	•	Manages I/O buffering and caching.
	•	Example:
Printing a document → OS uses printer driver.

5. Security & Protection
	•	What it does:
Protects data and resources from unauthorized access.
	•	Responsibilities:
	•	User authentication (login, passwords, biometrics).
	•	Access control (permissions for files/programs).
	•	Encryption and firewall services.
	•	Example:
Windows login screen, Linux chmod.

COMPONENTS OF OPERATING SYSTEM

1.	Kernel
	•	Core of the OS, directly interacts with hardware.
	•	Handles process, memory, and device management.

2.	Process Management
	•	Creates, schedules, and terminates processes.
	•	Responsible for CPU scheduling, multitasking, context switching.

3.	Memory Management
	•	Allocates and deallocates memory (RAM).
	•	Provides virtual memory using paging/segmentation.

4.	File System Management
	•	Manages storage of data and organization of files/directories.
	•	Controls file access, permissions, and metadata.

5.	Device Management
	•	Uses device drivers to control hardware devices.
	•	Manages input/output operations.

6.	I/O System Management
	•	Provides buffering, caching, and spooling.
	•	Ensures smooth data transfer between I/O devices and CPU.

7.	Security & Protection
	•	Protects system resources and user data.
	•	Provides authentication, access control, encryption.

8.	User Interface (Shell)
	•	Enables user to interact with OS.
	•	Two types:
	•	CLI (Command Line Interface) → e.g., Bash, PowerShell
	•	GUI (Graphical User Interface) → e.g., Windows desktop, Linux GNOME

HISTORY OF OPERATING SYSTEMS

1. Early Computers (No OS) – 1940s–1950s
	•	Programs were loaded using punch cards or switches.
	•	No operating system existed.
	•	Only one program ran at a time.
	•	Example: ENIAC, IBM 701.

2. Batch Processing Systems – 1950s–1960s
	•	Definition: Jobs (programs + data) were collected and executed in groups (batches), without user interaction during execution.
	•	Working:
	•	Users submitted jobs to an operator.
	•	Operator grouped jobs into a batch → fed into computer.
	•	Output was received later.
	•	Pros: Efficient use of CPU time, less idle time.
	•	Cons: No interaction with program while running, long turnaround time.
	•	Examples:
	•	IBM 1401 (used punch cards for batch jobs).
	•	IBM 7094.

3. Multiprogramming Systems – 1960s
	•	Definition: Multiple programs kept in memory at once; CPU switches between them when one waits for I/O.
	•	Advantage: Better CPU utilization.
	•	Example: IBM OS/360.

4. Time-Sharing Systems – 1960s–1970s
	•	Definition: Multiple users interact directly with the system simultaneously.
	•	CPU time is divided into time-slices for each user.
	•	Example: UNIX (early versions), CTSS.

5. Multi-Processing Systems – 1970s–1980s
	•	Definition: System with more than one CPU, working in parallel.
	•	Advantage: Increased speed and reliability.
	•	Example: DEC VAX, IBM System/370.

6. Personal Computer Era – 1980s–1990s
	•	Single-user, user-friendly OS with GUI.
	•	Examples:
	•	MS-DOS (CLI).
	•	Windows 95, Mac OS (GUI).

7. Modern OS – 2000s–Present
	•	Features: Multi-core, multi-threading, networking, cloud, mobile OS.
	•	Examples: Windows 11, macOS, Linux distributions (Ubuntu), Android, iOS.
